# Final class mock example in php

This repository contains an example on how build mock objects during test for classes marked as final.

Note:
If you run ubuntu, you can use the script: build.sh to quick start.
The script will try to install "Docker CE runtime" and "docker-compose" and do an "apt-get update" if needed.
